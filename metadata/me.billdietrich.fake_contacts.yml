Summary: Create fake phone contacts, for data-poisoning
Description: -|
    Create fake phone contacts, that will be stored on your phone
    along with your real contacts.  The idea is to feed fake data
    to any apps or companies who are copying our private data to
    use or sell it.  This is called "data-poisoning".
    
    Nothing about these fake contacts will interfere with your normal
    use of your phone or your real contacts.
